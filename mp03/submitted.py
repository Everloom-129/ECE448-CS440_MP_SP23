'''
This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

import numpy as np

def k_nearest_neighbors(image, train_images, train_labels, k):
    '''
    Parameters:
    image - one image
    train_images - a list of N images
    train_labels - a list of N labels corresponding to the N images
    k - the number of neighbors to return

    Output:
    neighbors - a list of k images, the k nearest neighbors of image
    labels - a list of k labels corresponding to the k images
    '''

    raise RuntimeError('You need to write this part!')


def classify_devset(dev_images, train_images, train_labels, k):
    '''
    Parameters:
    dev_images (list) -M images
    train_images (list) -N images
    train_labels (list) -N labels corresponding to the N images
    k (int) - the number of neighbors to use for each dev image

    Output:
    hypotheses (list) -one majority-vote labels for each of the M dev images
    scores (list) -number of nearest neighbors that voted for the majority class of each dev image
    '''
    
    raise RuntimeError('You need to write this part!')


def confusion_matrix(hypotheses, references):
    '''
    Parameters:
    hypotheses (list) - a list of M labels output by the classifier
    references (list) - a list of the M correct labels

    Output:
    confusions (list of lists, or 2d array) - confusions[m][n] is 
    the number of times reference class m was classified as
    hypothesis class n.
    accuracy (float) - the computed accuracy
    f1(float) - the computed f1 score from the matrix
