'''
This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

def create_frequency_table(train):
    '''
    Parameters:
    train (dict of list of lists) 
        - train[y][i][k] = k'th token of i'th text of class y

    Output:
    frequency (dict of Counters) 
        - frequency[y][x] = number of tokens of word x in texts of class y
    '''
    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def remove_stopwords(frequency):
    '''
    Parameters:
    frequency (dict of Counters) 
        - frequency[y][x] = number of tokens of word x in texts of class y

    Output:
    nonstop (dict of Counters) 
        - nonstop[y][x] = frequency of word x in texts of class y,
          but only if x is not a stopword.

    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def laplace_smoothing(nonstop, smoothness):
    '''
    Parameters:
    nonstop (dict of Counters) 
        - nonstop[y][x] = frequency of x in y, if x not a stopword
    smoothness (float)
        - smoothness = Laplace smoothing hyperparameter

    Output:
    likelihood (dict of dicts) 
        - likelihood[y][x] = Laplace-smoothed likelihood of x given y
        - likelihood[y]['OOV'] = likelihood of an out-of-vocabulary word given y

    Be careful that your vocabulary only counts words that occurred at least once
    in the training data for class y.

def naive_bayes(texts, likelihood, prior):
    '''
    Parameters:
    texts (list of lists) -
        - texts[i][k] = k'th token of i'th text
    likelihood (dict of dicts) 
        - likelihood[y][x] = Laplace-smoothed likelihood of x given y
    prior (float)
        - prior = the prior probability of the class called "pos"

    Output:
    hypotheses (list)
        - hypotheses[i] = class label for the i'th text

    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def optimize_hyperparameters(texts, labels, nonstop, priors, smoothnesses):
    '''
    Parameters:
    texts (list of lists) - dev set texts
        - texts[i][k] = k'th token of i'th text
    labels (list) - dev set labels
        - labels[i] = class label of i'th text
    nonstop (dict of Counters) 
        - nonstop[y][x] = frequency of word x in class y, x not stopword
    priors (list)
        - a list of different possible values of the prior
    smoothnesses (list)
        - a list of different possible values of the smoothness

    Output:
    accuracies (numpy array, shape = len(priors) x len(smoothnesses))
        - accuracies[m,n] = dev set accuracy achieved using the
          m'th candidate prior and the n'th candidate smoothness
