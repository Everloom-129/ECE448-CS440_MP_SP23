White goes first.  Players alternate making moves until white wins, black wins, or there is a tie.  You don't need to know anything else about chess to do the assignment, though you may have more fun if you learn just a little (e.g., by playing against the computer).\n",

    "2. **move**.  A move is a 3-list: `move==[fro,to,promote]`.\n",
    "`fro` is a 2-list: `fro==[from_x,from_y]`, where `from_x` and `from_y` are each numbers between 1 and 8, specifying the starting x and y positions.  `to` is also a 2-list: `to==[to_x,to_y]`.\n",
    "`promote` is either `None` or `\"q\"`, where `q` means that you are trying to promote your piece to a queen.\n",
    "3. **board**.  A board is a 2-tuple of lists of pieces: `board==([white_piece0, white_piece1, ...], [black_piece0, black_piece1, ...])`.\n",
    "Each piece is a 3-list: `piece=[x,y,type]`.\n",
    "`x` is the x position of the piece (left-to-right, 1 to 8).\n",
    "`y` is the y  position of the piece (top-to-bottom, 1 to 8).\n",
    "`type` is a letter indicating the type of piece, which can be (`p`=pawn, `r`=rook, `n`=knight, `b`=bishop, `q`=queen, or `k`=king).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get some better understanding, let's look at the way the board is initialized at the start of the game.  The function `chess.lib.convertMoves` starts with an initialized board, then runs forward through a series of specified moves, and gives us the resulting board.  If the series of specified moves is the empty string, then `chess.lib.convertMoves` gives us the opening board position:\n"
