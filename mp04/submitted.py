"""
This is the module you will submit to the autograder.

There are several function and variable definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.
You should replace each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

If you are not sure how to use PyTorch, you may want to take a look at the tutorial.
